# Surroundings

## Soil
- for easy construction preferably plane, free of rocks, dry, stable e.g. clay

## Orientation
- facing south-east, south or south-west for maximum sunlight and brightness
- outlook preferably until the horizon and/or to a aesthetic landscape

## Trees
- out of range of trees that are likely to fall within the next 100 years
- in preferred range of trees that spend shadow in summer and thereby prevent overheating

## Potential extreme dangers
- wildfire
- earth quake
- flooding
- landslide
- hurricane

(if any of these dangers are likely, then the building at this particular place should be reconsidered or the construction design should be adjusted)
