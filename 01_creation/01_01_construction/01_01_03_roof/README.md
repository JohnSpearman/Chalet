## Considerations and pitfalls

* especially female blackbirds rob the moss to build their nests in April and June
** to tackle this problem, a natural fibre net can be applied above the moss and fixated by the boards and stones
* in spring and summer the moss is very likely to dry over long time periods
** a granulate or wood fibre board can be placed under the moss and act like a sponge to store moisture
* the wooden boards applied to fixate the EPDM foil tend to twist while exposed to rain and sun
** better to use smaller board, e.g. macimal 50 cm long
