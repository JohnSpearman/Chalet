# Sustainability

# Initial thoughts

- The thinking begins with the physical principles
  -  energy <-> matter
  -  entropy <-> information
- Sunlight and water are the crucial sources
  - photovoltaics -> electricity -> movement and information processing
  - growth of building materials and food
- Heat ist produced by the inhabitants themselves

# Necessary exceptions
- stainless steel screws
- hot-dip galvanized earth screws
- EPDM foil for roof
- thermal insulation glass
- smart home components
- tools needed for construction
