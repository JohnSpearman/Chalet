Steps:
* Construction
  * Start with the physical foundation: design, materials, building process, and structural integrity. This is the base of the entire project.
* Energy
  * Once the structure is in place, the next logical step is to establish energy systems (solar, wind, batteries, etc.) that will power the cabin.
* Water
  * After energy, focus on water management: sourcing, filtration, storage, and sustainable usage. This ensures basic living needs are met off-grid.
* Internet & Connectivity
  * Next, set up communication and connectivity systems for the smart home features, remote work, or staying connected to the outside world.
* Smart Home
  * With power and water in place, the integration of smart home technology comes next: automation, energy management, security systems, etc.
* Sustainability
  * Finally, emphasize sustainable practices in building and living, such as passive design, eco-friendly materials, and long-term environmental impact.
